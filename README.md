Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process<br/>
* Renee's approach to jump into it was based on the runner file from the previous project initially. From there we modified it to incorporate all of the different desired player and computer interactions. We then placed everything inside of a new class, the Battleship class.<br/>

If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?<br/> 
* Maybe make the game text to be more video game-like<br/>
* The game returns user back to the start<br/>
* Refactor valid placement method to include more helper methods<br/>
* Make methods to account for different use case situations where user input is not recognizable by the computer<br/>
* Find a way to have the computer board and player board render side by side<br/>
* To have computer messages specific to which computer ship the player sunk<br/>

Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.<br/>
* We used a lot of driver-navigator pairing while in the study hall Zoom, sometimes utilizing VS Code Live Share where everyone could work on the code simultaneously. VS Code Live Share was useful when writing tests and class methods in tandem. We also used the ping-pong asynchronous sharing method, as well as sharing in-progress code over Slack.<br/>

Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.<br/> 
* Feedback was shared during live coding sessions, through Slack messages, and comments left on pull requests.
